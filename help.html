     <h2>About HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML(Hyper Text Markup language) is the standard markup language for Web pages, was created by Berners-Lee in the year 1991. Almost every web page over internet might be using HTML.</p>
    <h2>Syntax help</h2>
    <p><b>Fundamentals</b><br>
        Any HTML document must start with document declaration !DOCTYPE html
        HTML documents begin with html and ends with /html
        Headings are defined with h1 to h6 where h1 is the highest important heading and h6 is the least important sub-heading.
        Paragrahs are defined in p../p tag.
        Links are defined in a tag.
        </p>
        <p>

Buttons are defined in button>./button tag
Lists are defined in ul for unordered/bullet list and ol for ordered/number list, and the list items are defined in li.
<br>HTML Elements and Attributes
HTML element is everything present from start tag to end tag. <br>
The text present between start and end tag is called HTML element content. <br>
Anything can be a tagname but it's preferred to put the meaningful title to the content present as tag name.
<br>Do not forget the end tag. <br>
Elements with no content are called empty elements. <br>
Elements can have attributes which provides additional information about the element. <br>
In the below example, href is an attribute and a is the tag name. <br>
<b>HTML Tables </b> <br>
HTML Tables are defined in table tag. <br>
Table row should be defined in tr tag <br>
Table header should be defined in th tag <br>
Table data should be defined in td tag <br>
Table caption should be defined in aption tag <br>
<h2>CSS</h2>
CSS(cascading style sheets) describes how HTML elements will look on the web page like color, font-style, font-size, background color etc.
<br>

  padding: 25px; <br>
} <br>
.title { <br>
